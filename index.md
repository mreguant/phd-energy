In this **course**, we will learn about the **economics of energy**. The class is taught by [Mar Reguant](https://mreguant.github.io).

The goal of the course is threefold:
* Get familiar with trends and changes in the electricity market.
* Get familiar with how to use data and models of electricity markets. 
* Get familiar with how machine learning tools can help with the above.

## Syllabus
Find the syllabus [here](/materials/day0/syllabus_Energy_2024.pdf).

## Flow
In each module, we will cover topics in the first half of the class, and then we will do examples in the second half. You will be able to modify the exercises at home for additional practice.

In each **module page** you will find the necessary material:
* [Module 1](menu1): Introduction
* [Module 2](menu2): Supply side I
* [Module 3](menu3): Supply side II
* [Module 4](menu4): Demand side I
* [Module 5](menu5): Demand side II

## Preliminaries

We will be using [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) to run the exercises. For this, **you will need to install Julia in your computer, and Jupyter Notebooks.** 

You can follow this guide to [add Julia to Jupyter Notebooks](https://datatofish.com/add-julia-to-jupyter/).

:exclamation: It is **highly recommended** to make sure you can use Julia and Jupyter Notebooks before class starts. We will also spend time the first day to get this going.

:information_source: You can **test the installation** by checking this small workbook plotting installed wind capacity in a few select countries. Download the [exercise file](/materials/day0/day0.ipynb) and [data file](/materials/day0/cumulative-installed-wind-energy-capacity-gigawatts.csv) in the same folder, and open the exercise file in Jupyter Notebooks to get started.

## Further optional prep

We will be using **JuMP**, a **mathematical programming library for Julia**. You do not need to actively prep for this, but if you are eager to learn about it, you can find a great JuMP tutorial [here](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMPTutorials.jl).
