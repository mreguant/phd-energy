# Module 3: Supply side II

In the third module, we will talk about environmental regulation and how it affects participants in the electricity market. 

In the practical session, we will continue to learn how to use JuMP to build electricity models. We will incorporate investment and environmental regulation into a model with a richer set of plants. We will also practice ways in which to save and loop over several simulations.

## Practical exercise: Supply climate policies and leakage

The exercise will be based on the paper by Reguant (2019), "The Efficiency and Sectoral Distributional Impacts of Large-Scale Renewable Energy Policies". Reading the paper in advance is encouraged.
